A spartan bioinformatics package, providing only the essentials and nothing fancy or luxurious. Enough to get the job done quickly without flourish.

This is ``spartan``.  ``spartan`` is a central place that I have decided to store/develop
many of the bioinformatics classes/functions/scripts that I have written and find I use a lot.

As the name implies, this is pretty functional code, but I have only done MINIMAL user-proofing.
For the most part if a function/method expects a gff file you should do your due diligence that that
file is indeed formatted correctly.  If someone wants to add more, I welcome it.  However if I am going
to add code it will be to add functionality.

After all, this is ``spartan``.
